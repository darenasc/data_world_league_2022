    "3. üíª Develop your code - make sure to add comments and save all the output you want the jury to see. Your code **must be** runnable!\n",

    "Let's import the **clean data**. Details of how the data was cleaned are available in the appendix but here is a summary of the issues we identified and the decisions we made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The dataset was supposed to have `Load.ID` has a primary key, it wasn't the case so we removed duplicates and selected the first row of groups that shared a `Load.ID` (44 rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We removed rows with `Load.Weight` missing. 99.6% of them were in `SWEEPING` which we removed from the analysis anyway \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The time series is incomplete for some load types. We kept data from **2005** \n",
    "\n",
    "4) `Load.Type` categories don't seem mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be because over time, recycling streams got split into different categories or the data collection process changed over time. We kept the categories making up most of the waste, namely: **Brush, Bulk, Dead animal, Garbage collections, Litter, Mixed Litter, Recycled Metal, Recycling - single stream, Tires and Yard Trimming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5) There were some data errors and extreme values that needed to be removed from the analysis. We used an **isolation forest** to identify outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "6) We grouped the data by day, load type and route number\n",
