## [1. Predict Waste Production for its Reduction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbBl0-8da1YezzS7x6w9DVN61eliLPY9/view)
[pdf](docs/files/UrbanAI Challenge.pdf)

[According to the World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/), in 2016 cities generated 2.01 billion tons of solid waste. Per person, this is around 0.74 kg/day! With the rapid growth of cities, this number is only expected to increase. As cities are growing, it is urgent that optimization processes for waste processing and more targeted public education on waste management and separation. Finally, it is also important to note that waste collection also has an impact on air pollution.

### **Goal**
The goal of this challenge is to help identify trends in waste production and help to create insights into how to reduce waste and optimize its collection.

### **Outcome**
The expected outcome to this challenge is to identify waste trends and to produce an explainable model for predicting future waste production.
Finally, don’t forget to propose the application (product) for the model and study its impact.

## [2. Air Quality Prediction in Busy Streets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iqNzTNHwcaJzEZiZR3ImiZtlaNz6o4o5/view?usp=sharing)
[pdf](docs/files/UNStudio Challenge.pdf)

### **Goal**
The goal of this challenge is to help the initiators of the project create a case and buzz for the needed change in the street and more specifically for the current impact it has on air pollution.

### **Outcome**

Create an explainable predictive model for the different pollutants that are produced at Stadhouderskade and suggest how:
* It can be used by the Green Mile project to persuade governmental bodies and the public in the need for change;
* It can be used to create and influence the Green Mile (example: Can restrictions be applied based on the model’s predictions? Any warning system?)

Resources

* [Hourly measurements of different air pollutants](https://wdl-data.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/unstudio/stadhouderskade_air_quality_2014_to_2022.csv) at Stadhouderskade.
    * Please note, even though CO2 measurements are not provided, NOx is
provided which is also a dangerous car pollutant.
* OpenWeather API
